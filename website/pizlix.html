<p>Pizlix is <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/">LFS (Linux From Scratch) 12.2</a> with some added components, where userland is compiled with Fil-C. This means you get the most memory safe Linux-like OS currently available.</p>

<p>Caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The kernel is compiled with Yolo-C. So that you can compile the kernel, a copy of GCC is installed in <code>/yolo/bin/gcc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="compiler.html">C/C++ compiler</a> is compiled with Yolo-C++. Some more information about that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's likely that a production memory safe OS would still let you run unsafe programs in cases where the security/performance trade-off was warranted. The compiler might be a good example of that.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven't yet ported LLVM to Fil-C++, and so long as I haven't, the compiler will have to be Yolo-C++.</p></li>
<li><p>The compiler is called <code>/usr/bin/clang-20</code> but there are many symlinks to it (<code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>c++</code>, <code>clang</code>, and <code>clang++</code> all point at <code>clang-20</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>All of the other building-related tools (like <code>ld</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>ninja</code>, etc) are compiled with Fil-C (or Fil-C++).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Pizlix is possible because Fil-C is so compatible with C and C++ that many packages in LFS need no changes, and the rest of them mostly just require small changes. That said, it's not as simple as just replacing LFS's compiler with the Fil-C compiler because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Fil-C compiler isn't set up to do the cross-compilation hacks that LFS uses in Chapters 5-7. Therefore, Pizlix uses the Yolo-C toolchain and vanilla versions of the temporary cross-tools in those chapters.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to retain the Yolo GCC for compiling the Linux kernel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This document starts with a description of how to install and build Pizlix. <a href="#details">At the end of this document</a>, I explain exactly how Fil-C is injected into LFS.</p>

<h2>Supported Systems</h2>

<p>Pizlix has been tested inside VMware and Hyper-V on X86_64.</p>

<p>I have confirmed that it's possible to build Pizlix on Ubuntu 24.</p>

<h2>Installing Pizlix</h2>

<p>First, clone the <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/">Fil-C GH repo</a>:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then go into the <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/tree/deluge/pizlix"><code>pizlix</code> directory</a> under <code>fil-c</code>.</p>

<p>Pizlix requires you to set up your machine thusly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You must have a <code>/mnt/lfs</code> partition mounted at /dev/sda4. If you have it mounted somewhere else, then make sure you edit the various scripts in this directory (and its subdirectories).</p></li>
<li><p>You must have a swap partition at <code>/dev/sda3</code>. If you have one somewhere else (or don't have one), then make sure you edit the various scripts in this directory (and its subdirectories).</p></li>
<li><p>You must have an <code>lfs</code> user as described in sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/">LFS book</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have satisfied those requirements, <strong>and you're happy with the contents of <code>/mnt/lfs</code> being annihilated</strong>, just do:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ./build.sh
</code></pre>

<p>From <code>fil-c/pizlix</code>. Then, edit your grub config to include the <code>menuentry</code> in <code>etc/grub_custom</code> and reboot into Pizlix!</p>

<p>If you run into trouble, see the <a href="#stages">Build Stages</a>.</p>

<h2>Using Pizlix</h2>

<p>Pizlix by default has the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>sshd</code> is running. It's a memory safe OpenSSH daemon!</p></li>
<li><p><code>seatd</code> is running.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <code>root</code> user with password <code>root</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a user called <code>pizlo</code> with password <code>pizlo</code>. This user is a sudoer.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dhcpcd</code> is set to connect you via DHCP on <code>eth0</code>, which is assumed to be ethernet, not wifi.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please change the passwords, or better yet, replace the <code>pizlo</code> user with some other user, if your Pizlix install will face the network!</p>

<p>Once you get your internet to work (it will "just work" if <code>eth0</code> is DHCP capable), you'll need to run:</p>

<pre><code>make-ca -g
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>root</code>. Without this, <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> will have problems with HTTPS.</p>

<p>To see what this thing is really capable of, log in as a non-root user (like <code>pizlo</code>) and do:</p>

<pre><code>weston
</code></pre>

<p>And enjoy a totally memory safe GUI!</p>

<h2>Build Stages</h2>

<p>The Pizlix build proceeds in the following stages.</p>

<p>The Pizlix build snapshots after each successful stage so that it's possible to restart the build at that stage later. This is great for troubleshooting!</p>

<h3>Pre-LC</h3>

<p>This is the bootstrapping phase that uses a Yolo-C GCC to build a Yolo-C toolchain within the <code>/mnt/lfs</code> chroot environment.</p>

<p>If you want to just do this stage of the build and nothing more, do <code>sudo ./build_prelc.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to start the build here, do <code>sudo ./build.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>LC</h3>

<p>This is the phase where the chroot environment is pizlonated with a Fil-C compiler. This builds the Fil-C compiler and slams it into <code>/mnt/lfs</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to just do this stage of the build and nothing more, do <code>sudo ./build_lc.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to start the build here, do <code>sudo ./build_with_recovered_prelc.sh</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="#details">Injecting Fil-C Into LFS</a> section describes the LC phase, and its relationship to Pre-LC and Post-LC.</p>

<h3>Post-LC</h3>

<p>This is the actual Linux From Scratch build (Chapters 8, 9, 10 of the LFS book) using the Fil-C toolchain. After this completes, the Yolo-C stuff produced in Pre-LC is mostly eliminated, except for what is necessary to run the Fil-C compiler and the GCC used for building the kernel.</p>

<p>If you want to just do this stage of the build and nothing more, do <code>sudo ./build_postlc.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to start the build here, do <code>sudo ./build_with_recovered_lc.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>Post-LC 2</h3>

<p>This builds BLFS (Beyond Linux From Scratch) components that I like to have, such as openssh, emacs, dhcpcd, and cmake.</p>

<p>If you want to just do this stage of the build and nothing more, do <code>sudo ./build_postlc2.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to start the build here, do <code>sudo ./build_with_recovered_postlc.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>Post-LC 3</h3>

<p>This builds the Wayland environment and Weston so that you can have a GUI.</p>

<p>If you want to just do this stage of the build and nothing more, do <code>sudo ./build_postlc3.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to start the build here, do <code>sudo ./build_with_recovered_postlc2.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>Other Tricks</h3>

<p>You can mount the chroot's virtual filesystems with <code>sudo ./build_mount.sh</code>. You can unmount the chroot's virtual filesystems with <code>sudo ./build_unmount.sh</code>.</p>

<p>You can hop into the chroot with <code>sudo ./enter_chroot.sh</code>. However, if you're past Post-LC, then you'll need to do <code>sudo ./enter_chroot_late.sh</code> instead.</p>

<p>If you want to just rebuild <code>libpizlo.so</code> runtime and slam it into the chroot, do <code>sudo ./rebuild_pas.sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to just rebuild the compiler, <code>libpizlo.so</code>, and user glibc, do <code>sudo ./rebuild_lc.sh</code>.</p>

<p><a name="details"></a></p>

<h2>Injecting Fil-C Into LFS</h2>

<p>My process for building Pizlix started with writing shell scripts to automate the LFS build. This mostly involved copy-pasting the shell commands from the LFS book after manually validating that they worked for me.</p>

<p>Then, I studied the build process to identify the best injection point for Fil-C. That is, where to either compile or binary-drop the Fil-C compiler and have all subsequent build steps use that compiler. After some trial and error, I found that the second glibc build step (<a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/chapter08/glibc.html">the one at start of Chapter 8</a>) is the perfect point to transition from Yolo-C to Fil-C:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At this point, we are no longer building temporary cross versions of libraries in tools. We're building the final versions.</p></li>
<li><p>We have built good-enough versions of libraries and tools to support running <a href="compiler.html">the Fil-C compiler</a>. Note that in preparation for this, I had already adjusted the clang build so that it the binary has minimal dependencies and happens to dynamically link to a glibc with the same ABI version as LFS's glibc (version 2.40). It's great that glibc ABI is so stable these days that this is possible!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is why the build stages have the names that they do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pre-LC: this is the "pre libc" part of the build, i.e. Chapters 5-7.</p></li>
<li><p>LC: this is the part of the build where LFS would have normally build the final (not cross) version of glibc, i.e. <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/chapter08/glibc.html">section 8.5</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-LC: this is all of the LFS build that happens after the final glibc step, i.e. everything after section 8.5. However, I also include the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/chapter08/man-pages.html">section 8.3 man-pages</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/chapter08/iana-etc.html">section 8.4 iana-etc</a> as the first steps of Post-LC. It turns out that it's OK to run these steps after the final glibc build.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's how the various build stages are modified to support Fil-C.</p>

<h3>Modifying Pre-LC</h3>

<p>In normal LFS, most of the Pre-LC tools are built with <code>--prefix=/usr</code> even though these are not the final versions of the tools. Post-LC overwrites the tools build in this bootstraping phase.</p>

<p>It turns out that I cannot quite do this for Fil-C, because Fil-C does not share ABI with Yolo-C. So, we do not want situations like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pre-LC builds library <code>libfoo.so</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-LC builds a binary <code>bar</code> that dynamically links <code>libfoo.so</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-LC builds library <code>libfoo.so</code> and overwrites the version from Pre-LC.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If we did that, then <code>bar</code> would stop functioning, since <code>bar</code> is a Yolo executable and <code>libfoo.so</code> is now a Fil library. The same kind of problem would occur if in step 3, Post-LC built <code>bar</code> with Fil-C - we'd have a Fil binary dynamically linking to a Yolo library. It wouldn't work!</p>

<p>So, Pre-LC takes the following approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We build everything with <code>--prefix=/yolo</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We use symlinks to make it seem like everything is in <code>/usr</code>. For example, <code>/usr/bin</code> is a symlink to <code>/yolo/bin</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code> is a symlink to <code>/yolo/lib</code>. Also, <code>/bin</code> is a symlink to <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/lib</code> is a symlink to <code>/usr/lib</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of Pre-LC, all libraries and binaries are actually installed in <code>/yolo</code>, but they function as if they were installed in <code>/usr</code> in the sense that the glibc loader is going to look for libraries in <code>/lib</code> and lots of software (like lots of shell scripts) point at <code>/bin</code> or <code>/usr/bin</code> directly.</p>

<h3>Modifying LC</h3>

<p>The LC phase is where most of the magic happens. LC has multiple substages: Fil-C build, yoloify, yolo glibc build, Fil-C binary drop, user glibc build, and finally libc++ binary drop. Note that the need for two glibcs - yolo and user - is due to the <a href="runtime.html">libc sandwich runtime</a>.</p>

<h4>Fil-C Build</h4>

<p>The first stage of LC is to build Fil-C in a way that is almost identical to <code>./build_all_fast_glibc.sh</code> except that we force the use of the kernel headers from the version of the kernel that Pizlix uses. We will use the clang compiler binary, <code>libpizlo.so</code>, libc++abi, and libc++ libraries as binary drops into Pizlix in later parts of LC.</p>

<p>This also packages up yolo glibc and user glibc so that they can be built inside the Pizlix chroot.</p>

<h4>Yoloify</h4>

<p>Now we break the symlinks from <code>/usr</code> to <code>/yolo</code>. To do this without breaking the bootstrap binaries, we also <code>patchelf</code> all of the binaries so that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They know that the ELF interpreter (i.e. ELF dynamic loader) is in <code>/yolo/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>They know that their rpath is in <code>/yolo/lib</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, all scripts that use absolute paths to their interpreter (i.e. <code>#!</code>) is in <code>/yolo/bin</code>.</p>

<h4>Yolo glibc Build</h4>

<p>Now we build <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/tree/deluge/projects/yolo-glibc-2.40">yolo glibc</a> (i.e. the version of glibc 2.40 hacked to be the Yolo libc in the <a href="runtime.html">Fil-C  sandwich runtime</a>) inside the Pizfix chroot. This is a very hacked glibc build:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We build yolo glibc using GCC, since it's a Yolo-C component that sits below the Fil-C runtime.</p></li>
<li><p>We disable a bunch of features, since Fil-C only uses this libc for syscalls in the Fil-C runtime. In the future, we could even get rid of the yolo libc altogether!</p></li>
<li><p>We pretend that <code>--prefix=/usr</code>. In some ways, that's true.</p></li>
<li><p>After glibc is installed, we delete everything it places in <code>/usr</code> except for the <code>libc</code>, <code>libm</code>, and <code>ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> shared objects.</p></li>
<li><p>We rename those shared objects so that <code>libc.so.6</code> becomes <code>libyolocimpl.so</code>, <code>libm.so.6</code> becomes <code>libyolomimpl.so</code>, and <code>ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> becomes <code>ld-yolo-x86_64.so</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the yolo glibc is installed in such a way that <code>libpizlo.so</code> and the <a href="compiler.html">Fil-C compiler</a> know how to find it. And, most importantly, it's installed in such a way that it stays out of the way of the user glibc (which will claim the <code>libc</code> and <code>libm</code> library namespace).</p>

<h4>Fil-C Binary Drop</h4>

<p>This part is very hackish! I haven't ported <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/tree/deluge/libpas"><code>libpizlo.so</code></a> to build with GCC. So, rather than porting it or having Yolo clang in Pre-LC, this step just binary drops the <code>libpizlo.so</code> we've already built into <code>/usr/lib</code>. This also drops the Fil-C headers into <code>/usr/include</code>.</p>

<p>This step also binary drops the <a href="compiler.html">Fil-C compiler</a> - a clang binary that only dynamically links glibc ABI version 6 - into <code>/usr/bin</code> and sets up the symlinks (so <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>c++</code>, <code>clang</code>, and <code>clang++</code> all point to this compiler).</p>

<h4>User glibc Build</h4>

<p>Now we build <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/tree/deluge/projects/user-glibc-2.40">user glibc</a> (i.e. the version of glibc 2.40 that has been ported to Fil-C) inside the Pizfix chroot. This is almost exactly the build process used in <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2/chapter08/glibc.html">Section 8.5 of LFS</a>, except we're using a version of glibc 2.40 that has been ported to Fil-C and we're compiling with the <a href="compiler.html">Fil-C compiler</a> rather than GCC.</p>

<h4>libc++ Binary Drop</h4>

<p>Ideally, we'd build libc++abi and libc++ within the Pizfix chroot, but for now I'm being lazy so I just binary drop the versions I've already built.</p>

<p>This concludes the LC phase! Now it's possible to proceed with the rest of the LFS build. That build will end up using the Fil-C compiler even if the build scripts explicitly ask for <code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code>, and they will get a Fil-C version of glibc, and libc++abi/libc++ as their C++ libraries.</p>

<h3>Modifying Post-LC</h3>

<p>Post-LC is almost exactly the LFS chapters 8-10 except for the glibc step (which we already did in the LC phase). The only changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some programs required minor modifications to work in Fil-C.</p></li>
<li><p>The Linux kernel needs to be built using two compilers. The "host" compiler is the <a href="compiler.html">Fil-C compiler</a>. So, there are minor changes in the userlevel parts of the Linux kernel and the exact commands used to invoke the build are a bit more verbose.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pizlix also includes a Post-LC 2 and Post-LC 3 phases that build some parts of <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/12.2/">BLFS 12.2</a> plus enough to run Weston.</p>
