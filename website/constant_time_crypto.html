<h1>Constant-Time Crypto</h1>

<p>Cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL are engineered to ensure that timing side channels cannot be used to extract secrets. For example, it should not be possible to guess the key used to encrypt data based on how long the encryption took. It's hard to guarantee the lack of timing side channels! The tradecraft used to maintain this guarantee is called <em>constant-time crypto</em>. Note that this does not mean that the crypto has running time that is constant in input size (encrypting a larger data set is expected to take longer and that's not a problem). It just means that time does not vary based on secrets.</p>

<p>Writing crypto that has the constant time property is hard because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some CPU instructions will take longer for some inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Tempting optimizations that are sensible in normal code break constant time crypto (like returning <code>false</code> early from a failing string comparison).</p></li>
<li><p>Compilers are not engineered to avoid transformations that would break constant time crypto.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last problem is the trickiest. Compilers are engineered as a large combination of compiler passes that interoperate under a simple contract: the <em>behavior</em> of the code that was an input to a pass is identical to the behavior of the output code. By <em>behavior</em> we just mean what side effects the code produces and what value it returns. Timing is not part of the contract! At best, end-to-end average performance on benchmarks is part of the contract, but even that is secondary to whether the code "behaved" the same. That is to say, <em>it is not a bug for a compiler to transform constant-time code into variable-time code</em>. Simple cases where this might happen is if the compiler identifies a fast-path/slow-path opportunity in some arithmetic, and introduces a branch, not knowing that it's branching on a secret. But because of the sheer sophistication of compilers (<a href="compiler.html">check out the Fil-C compiler LLVM pass pipeline</a>), proving that there does not exist a pass (or an emergent behavior between passes) that breaks constant-time crypto is impractical.</p>

<p>For this reason, <strong>the safest way to write constant time crypto is to write it in assembly</strong>.</p>

<p>This presents a challege for Fil-C! Fil-C currently does not have a story for making assembly memory safe. Also, Fil-C does not have a good story for linking Yolo-C libraries with Fil-C libraries. Hence, our options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Compile crypto libraries like OpenSSL with assembly turned off. This is what I used to do with OpenSSL for Fil-C. Unfortunately, this is a net security regression. Although we might be fixing possible memory safety issues in assembly code, we are more likely to be introducing timing side channels that users of Yolo-OpenSSL don't have to worry about.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Find a way to link OpenSSL's assembly code into OpenSSL compiled with Fil-C!</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This document goes into the gory details of how I linked OpenSSL's assembly code into OpenSSL compiled with Fil-C. This required a ~90KB change to OpenSSL 3.3.1. I have confirmed that this change passes all of OpenSSL's tests. I have also confirmed that SSH, curl, and other clients of OpenSSL work fine with this change.</p>

<p>The discussion is organized as follows. First I introduce new Fil-C API, which gives us a minimal FFI that is just enough for calling out to assembly code that quacks according to Yolo-C ABI. Then I go through the changes to OpenSSL, file by file, and show you the full diff with explanations of every change.</p>

<h2>Limited FFI To Yolo-Land</h2>

<p>OpenSSL's interop between C and assembly is confined to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C code calls assembly code. Never the other way around. Except for one case that I chose not to support, those calls are direct calls (the C code is calling a function by name, not by function pointer). Almost all of these calls involve passing pointers from C code to assembly code. The reverse almost never happens (in the one case where assembly returns a pointer, it's just offset from a pointer that was passed to assembly).</p></li>
<li><p>C code and assembly code share a global variable. In the case where this happens, the global happens to be defined in assembly, but it would make not difference to have it be defined in C code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, I added three features to Fil-C: an unsafe call mechanism that uses Yolo-C ABI, a way to request pointer safety checks from Fil-C, and a way to share globals using Yolo-C ABI.</p>

<h3>Unsafe Call Using Yolo-C ABI</h3>

<p>I introduced the following new intrinsic functions to <a href="stdfil.html"><code>&lt;stdfil.h&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>/* Performs an unsafe call to Yolo-land.

   This barely works! It's not intended for full-blown interop with Yolo code. In particular, right
   now Fil-C code expects to live in a Fil-C runtime, which precludes the use of a Yolo libc.

   This function is mostly useful for implementing constant-time crypto libraries or other kernels
   that need to be written in assembly.

   The first argument is the Yolo symbol name of the function to be called. It must be a string
   literal. The remaining arguments are passed along using Yolo C ABI conventions. */
unsigned long zunsafe_call(const char* symbol_name, ...);

/* Exactly like `zunsafe_call`, but for those cases where you know that the call will complete in a
   bounded (and sufficiently short) amount of time.

   In the worst case, if you call this instead of zunsafe_call, then you're just delaying GC progress.
   It's not the end of the world. Maybe we're talking about denial of service, at worst.

   This only turns into a big problem if you use zunsafe_fast_call to do something that has truly
   unbounded execution time (like a syscall that blocks indefinitely, or an infinite loop). Otherwise
   it's a perf pathology that you may or may not care enough to fix. */
unsigned long zunsafe_fast_call(const char* symbol_name, ...);

/* Performs either a `zunsafe_fast_call` or `zunsafe_call` depending on the `size`. */
unsigned long zunsafe_buf_call(__SIZE_TYPE__ size, const char* symbol_name, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>Let's talk about <code>zunsafe_call</code> in detail first. The <code>symbol_name</code> argument is special; it must be a string constant or else the compiler will give an error (an ICE currently). Then the compiler emits a function call to <code>symbol_name</code> (without any mangling!) with the arguments passed using Yolo-C ABI (which is what OpenSSL's assembly code expects). Currently this only supports returning <code>unsigned long</code> (i.e. a 64-bit integer). Note that if the function really returns a smaller integer, then this still works, but you can't place too many expectations on the upper bits of the integer (though in practice it will be zero-extended).</p>

<p>There's one quirk here that requires more than just one function. The <a href="compiler.html">Fil-C compiler</a> normally emits <a href="safepoints.html#pollchecks">pollchecks</a> in the code it generates to allow for low-overhead synchronization with the <a href="fugc.html">garbage collector</a>. We can't expect the assembly code to know how to do that. So, <code>zunsafe_call</code> performs an <a href="safepoints.html#native">exit</a> around the native call. This is sound, but carries significant performance downside: each exit is at least an atomic compare-and-swap, and then requires a subsequent enter, which is another atomic compare-and-swap. Currently, the Fil-C implementation of exit/enter is not optimized, so it's really a function call for exit and for enter.</p>

<p>Luckily, we do not need to exit/enter if the assembly code has short running time. So, this API comes with two additional functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>zunsafe_fast_call</code>, which is just like <code>zunsafe_call</code> but does not exit or enter. The worst case of calling <code>zunsafe_fast_call</code> instead of <code>zunsafe_call</code> is that if the native function blocks, then the GC blocks, too. Then you might run out of memory.</p></li>
<li><p><code>zunsafe_buf_call</code>, which decides whether to <code>zunsafe_fast_call</code> or <code>zunsafe_call</code> based on the <code>size</code> argument. Note that this is just heuristic-based, so we don't have to trip about whether <code>size</code> should be measured in bits, bytes, words, or blocks.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual Safety Checks</h3>

<p>Anytime we use <code>zunsafe_call</code> and friends to pass pointers to assembly code, we should check that those pointers point at the kind of data that the assembly code will want to access. Writing checks by hand is never going to be as good having the compiler insert checks, but it is better than not having any checks at all.</p>

<p>As a foundation for manual checking, I first added API to <a href="stdfil.html"><code>&lt;stdfil.h&gt;</code></a> that allows a Fil-C program to trigger a Fil-C memory safety error.</p>

<pre><code>void zsafety_error(const char* str);
void zsafety_errorf(const char* str, ...);

#define ZSAFETY_CHECK(exp) do { \
        if ((exp)) \
            break; \
        zsafety_errorf("%s:%d: %s: safety check %s failed.", \
                       __FILE__, __LINE__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, #exp); \
    } while (0)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, based on this API, I added the following checking functions in <a href="stdfil.html"><code>&lt;stdfil.h&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>static inline void zcheck(void* ptr, __SIZE_TYPE__ size)
{
    if (!size)
        return;
    if (!zvalinbounds(ptr, size))
        zsafety_errorf("%zu bytes are not in bounds of %P.", size, ptr);
    if (zis_readonly(ptr))
        zsafety_errorf("%P is readonly.", ptr);
}

static inline void zcheck_readonly(const void* ptr, __SIZE_TYPE__ size)
{
    if (!size)
        return;
    if (!zvalinbounds((void*)ptr, size))
        zsafety_errorf("%zu bytes are not in bounds of %P.", size, ptr);
}

static inline __SIZE_TYPE__ zchecked_add(__SIZE_TYPE__ a, __SIZE_TYPE__ b)
{
    __SIZE_TYPE__ result;
    if (__builtin_add_overflow(a, b, &amp;result))
        zsafety_errorf("%zu + %zu overflowed.", a, b);
    return result;
}

static inline __SIZE_TYPE__ zchecked_mul(__SIZE_TYPE__ a, __SIZE_TYPE__ b)
{
    __SIZE_TYPE__ result;
    if (__builtin_mul_overflow(a, b, &amp;result))
        zsafety_errorf("%zu * %zu overflowed.", a, b);
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows Fil-C code to easily do safety checks and have the failures reported as Fil-C memory safety errors. My changes to OpenSSL use these functions a lot.</p>

<h3>Sharing Globals With Yolo-Land</h3>

<p>OpenSSL has a global variable that is shared between C and assembly for tracking the set of capabilities that the CPU has. The variable is defined in assembly, initialized in C, and read from both C and assembly.</p>

<p>In order for the variable to be accessible from Fil-C, it needs to have a <a href="invisicaps.html">Fil-C capability</a> and it needs to be tracked by the <a href="fugc.html">GC</a>. So, it's most natural to define the variable in C. It's easy to change OpenSSL to define the variable in C rather than assembly.</p>

<p>But then we still need to have a way to expose the variable to assembly using Yolo-C ABI (i.e. via an unmangled name). Normally, Fil-C mangles all symbol names and in the case of globals, those mangled names do not point to the actual global variable the way that the symbol name would in Yolo-C ABI. So, I added a compiler directive called <code>.filc_unsafe_export</code>. Here's an example of how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>int global;
asm(".filc_unsafe_export global");
</code></pre>

<p>This has no effect on how <code>global</code> appears to the Fil-C program. But it does create a Yolo-C ABI symbol called <code>global</code> that aliases the payload of the <code>global</code> variable. Assembly code that expects to access <code>global</code> can do it just as if <code>global</code> had been defined by Yolo-C.</p>

<h2>The OpenSSL 3.3.1 Change</h2>

<p>Now let's go through the whole 90KB change to OpenSSL 3.3.1 to make it compile with Fil-C while leveraging assembly for much of the crypto engine implementation.</p>

<p>With this change, we can build OpenSSL with these settings:</p>

<pre><code>CC=&lt;path to Fil-C clang&gt; ./Configure zlib
</code></pre>

<p>The change I'm describing here landed in the following GitHub commits:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/commit/9323262508f5f03da40ca6122b1e6faa7c27e610"><code>9323262</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/commit/8f7f8cd72fa77c33cdd803fa4b0f7210233dce9e"><code>8f7f8cd</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/commit/dfb7383fe959451aa9c7a526b7ca08cb70a6e07a"><code>dfb7383</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/commit/76f9fca0dbe3fc36eb2e24c84b0199a7d2c7ca33"><code>76f9fca</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the follow-on fixes are thanks to me writing this document, which forced me to review what I had done and rationalize it. One of the goals of publishing this document is the hope that others might also find more issues and <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/issues">tell me about them</a>.</p>

<h3>New File: <code>crypto/aes/aes_asm_forward.c</code></h3>

<p>This new file provides forwarding functions from Fil-C to assembly for the basic AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) implementation. Normally, if OpenSSL called <code>AES_set_encrypt_key</code> (for example), then the call would directly go to the assembly implementation of that function. But in Fil-C, such a call goes to the Fil-C ABI variant of that function, which has a different mangling and different calling convention.</p>

<p>So, for every function implemented in assembly, we introduce a C function of the same name that wraps a call to <code>zunsafe_call</code> or one of its variants.</p>

<pre><code>#include "internal/deprecated.h"

#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/crypto.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/aes.h&gt;
#include "aes_local.h"
#include &lt;stdfil.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We start by including the same headers the other AES files in OpenSSL include.</p>

<pre><code>int AES_set_encrypt_key(const unsigned char *userKey, const int bits,
                        AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(userKey, zchecked_add(bits, 7) / 8);
    zcheck(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    return zunsafe_buf_call(bits, "AES_set_encrypt_key", userKey, bits, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In a perfect world, OpenSSL would validate everything about the buffers being passed to assembly. But in our changes to OpenSSL, we make no such assumptions. So, we check that the <code>userKey</code> really has the bits that are being asked for, and that the <code>key</code> is really an <code>AES_KEY</code> struct by emitting our own checks. This protects the memory safety of the process in case the <code>bits</code> object was not big enough, or if the <code>key</code> pointer was pointing at something smaller than an <code>AES_KEY</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int AES_set_decrypt_key(const unsigned char *userKey, const int bits,
                        AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(userKey, zchecked_add(bits, 7) / 8);
    zcheck(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    return zunsafe_buf_call(bits, "AES_set_decrypt_key", userKey, bits, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Same as <code>AES_set_encrypt_key</code>.</p>

<pre><code>void AES_encrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                 const AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, 16);
    zcheck(out, 16);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zunsafe_fast_call("AES_encrypt", in, out, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This encrypts a single block, which is 16 bytes (128 bits). It's common practice in OpenSSL to use magical constants for cases where it's standardizes (the AES standard fixes the block size at 128 bits/16 bytes). We use <code>zunsafe_fast_call</code> because this is a constant-time operation.</p>

<pre><code>void AES_decrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                 const AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, 16);
    zcheck(out, 16);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zunsafe_fast_call("AES_decrypt", in, out, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Same as <code>AES_encrypt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>void AES_cbc_encrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                     size_t length, const AES_KEY *key,
                     unsigned char *ivp, const int enc)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, length);
    zcheck(out, length);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zcheck(ivp, 16);
    zunsafe_buf_call(length, "AES_cbc_encrypt", in, out, length, key, ivp, enc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This implements the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode for AES. Here, an initial block is given (the intial block for CBC is called the IV or ivec, here it's in the <code>ivp</code> variable) and must be 16 bytes (the AES block size). The input/output must have <code>length</code> bytes.</p>

<h3>New File: <code>crypto/aes/aes_asm_forward.c</code></h3>

<p>This file provides forwarding functions to the assembly implementation of AES using the Intel AES-NI extension.</p>

<pre><code>#include "internal/deprecated.h"

#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/crypto.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/aes.h&gt;
#include "crypto/modes.h"
#include "crypto/aes_platform.h"
#include &lt;stdfil.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>First we include the headers that other AES files include.</p>

<pre><code>int aesni_set_encrypt_key(const unsigned char *userKey, int bits,
                          AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(userKey, zchecked_add(bits, 7) / 8);
    zcheck(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    return zunsafe_buf_call(bits, "aesni_set_encrypt_key", userKey, bits, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just like <code>AES_set_encrypt_key</code>, this takes a user key whose length is specified by <code>bits</code> and converts it to the internal <code>AES_KEY</code> struct.</p>

<pre><code>int aesni_set_decrypt_key(const unsigned char *userKey, int bits,
                          AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(userKey, zchecked_add(bits, 7) / 8);
    zcheck(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    return zunsafe_buf_call(bits, "aesni_set_decrypt_key", userKey, bits, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Same as <code>AES_set_encrypt_key</code> but for decryption.</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_encrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                   const AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, 16);
    zcheck(out, 16);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zunsafe_fast_call("aesni_encrypt", in, out, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does one block (16 bytes) of AES encryption.</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_decrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                   const AES_KEY *key)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, 16);
    zcheck(out, 16);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zunsafe_fast_call("aesni_decrypt", in, out, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does one block (16 bytes) of AES decryption.</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_ecb_encrypt(const unsigned char *in,
                       unsigned char *out,
                       size_t length, const AES_KEY *key, int enc)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, length);
    zcheck(out, length);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zunsafe_buf_call(length, "aesni_ecb_encrypt", in, out, length, key, enc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does <code>length</code> bytes of AES ECB encryption or decryption (based on the value of <code>enc</code>).</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_cbc_encrypt(const unsigned char *in,
                       unsigned char *out,
                       size_t length,
                       const AES_KEY *key, unsigned char *ivec, int enc)
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, length);
    zcheck(out, length);
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zcheck(ivec, 16);
    zunsafe_buf_call(length, "aesni_cbc_encrypt", in, out, length, key, ivec, enc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does <code>length</code> bytes of AES CBC encryption or decryption (based on the value of <code>enc</code>). Since it's CBC mode, an initial block is required (the <code>ivec</code>, which points at 16 bytes).</p>

<pre><code>#  ifndef OPENSSL_NO_OCB
</code></pre>

<p>The AES-NI implementation comes with offset codebook mode (OCB). This mode is enabled in the default build (i.e. <code>OPENSSL_NO_OCB</code> is not set).</p>

<pre><code>static size_t l_size(size_t blocks, size_t start_block_num)
{
    size_t blocks_processed = start_block_num - 1;
    size_t all_num_blocks = zchecked_add(blocks, blocks_processed);
    size_t result = 0;
    while (all_num_blocks &gt;&gt;= 1)
        result = zchecked_add(result, 1);
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>OCB mode involves a lookup table whose size is logarithmic in the number of blocks previously processed (i.e. <code>blocks_processed</code> and the number of new blocks (i.e. <code>blocks</code>). This helper computes the expected size of that lookup table.</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_ocb_encrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                       size_t blocks, const void *key,
                       size_t start_block_num,
                       unsigned char offset_i[16],
                       const unsigned char L_[][16],
                       unsigned char checksum[16])
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, zchecked_mul(blocks, 16));
    zcheck(out, zchecked_mul(blocks, 16));
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zcheck(offset_i, 16);
    zcheck_readonly(L_, zchecked_mul(16, l_size(blocks, start_block_num)));
    zcheck(checksum, 16);
    zunsafe_buf_call(blocks, "aesni_ocb_encrypt", in, out, blocks, key, start_block_num, offset_i, L_, checksum);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function implements OCB encryption. <code>blocks</code> tells us the number of blocks in <code>in</code> and <code>out</code>. Blocks are 16 bytes like in any other AES mode. <code>start_block_num</code> affects the required size of the lookup table (see <code>l_size</code> above).</p>

<p>Note that I'm using <code>zchecked_mul</code> to find out the byte size to check. This protects the safety checks from integer overflow attacks.</p>

<pre><code>void aesni_ocb_decrypt(const unsigned char *in, unsigned char *out,
                       size_t blocks, const void *key,
                       size_t start_block_num,
                       unsigned char offset_i[16],
                       const unsigned char L_[][16],
                       unsigned char checksum[16])
{
    zcheck_readonly(in, zchecked_mul(blocks, 16));
    zcheck(out, zchecked_mul(blocks, 16));
    zcheck_readonly(key, sizeof(AES_KEY));
    zcheck(offset_i, 16);

<p>This encryption mode only works for 4 or 8 buffers. This is specified by the <code>n4x</code> argument, which is either 1 (indicating 4 buffers) or 2 (indicating 8 buffers).</p>

<p>This function would be arguably safer if we passed a copy of <code>desc</code> to assembly, since that would avoid time-of-check-to-time-of-use vulnerabilities. However, the <code>desc</code> is always stack-allocated and local to the caller, so the additional protection of making a copy would be overkill.</p>

<p>This is a tricky function that I initially got subtly wrong. Although AES uses 16 byte blocks, the <code>blocks</code> argument is in units of 64 bytes, since that is the SHA1 block size. I confirmed that multiplying by anything larger than 64 results in the OpenSSL test suite failing, and I double-checked the assembly code (which shifts the <code>blocks</code> argument by 6, indicating a multiplication by 64).</p>

<p>As with the AES-SHA1 stitching, I originally made the mistake of assuming that <code>blocks</code> was referring to AES blocks, i.e. 16 bytes. It's not - this uses SHA256 blocks, which are 64 bytes, even when measuring the size of the AES input/output.</p>

<p>This disables an X86-specific optimization using inline assembly that relies on the fact that the X86 <code>div</code> instruction returns both the quotient and remainder.</p>

<p>Fil-C only supports trivial inline assembly where the instruction sequence is blank. This kind of "assembly" is used to inhibit compiler optimizations. In the future, Fil-C will support inline assembly with simple instructions (like <code>div</code>), but today that does not work. Based on reading this code, I believe that the inline assembly is only there as an optimization rather than the ensure constant time execution, so it's safe to just disable it.</p>

<p>The big number implementation for X86_64 contains a lot of extra stuff, which all looks like optimizations for CPUs that have more advanced features. Because I wanted to keep the first pass at this simple, I only enabled the assembly paths that I believed are necessary to have constant time crypto. This means just the montgomery multiplication. Because <code>x86_64-mont.s</code> uses a function defined in <code>x86_64-mont5.s</code>, I also include that file. However, I don't provide wrappers for mont5, so I pretend that mont5 is disabled (<code>OPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT5</code> is excluded from <code>$BNDEF_x86_64</code>).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The first part of this change is about how <code>OPENSSL_cpuid_setup</code> is called. Normally, OpenSSL uses assembly code to register a global constructor to call this function, but that requires having assembly code calling C code, which Fil-C doesn't support. Luckily, we can register global constructors from C, so that's what we do with the <code>init</code> function.</p>

<p>Then, we provide an implementation of <code>OPENSSL_cleanse</code>, which is basically a secure <code>bzero</code>. Normally, OpenSSL implements this in assembly, to be extra super sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's constant time (does not depend on the contents of the buffer being cleansed).</p></li>
<li><p>Definitely zeroes the memory no matter what kinds of opinions the compiler may have.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We could just forward to this function from Fil-C, but that would result in the capabilities associated with the memory not being zeroed. Maybe that would be OK from a security standpoint, but it feels shady enough that I'd rather we zero the capabilities. Also, the Fil-C <code>zmemset</code> function is specifically designed to <em>not</em> be something the compiler optimizes. It's a hard guarantee in Fil-C that the compiler will always view <code>zmemset</code> as an opaque function call, and never inline it or optimize it in any way.</p>

<p>And, <code>zmemset</code> does zero the capability, and neither the musl nor glibc <code>memset</code> implementations that this uses have any dependency on the contents of the buffer.</p>

<p>For <code>CRYPTO_memcmp</code> however, we forward to the assembly implementation, because there is no guarantee that the libc implementations are sufficiently constant time.</p>

<p>We also provide forwarding functions <code>OPENSSL_rdtsc</code> (read timestamp counter, used for performance measurement), <code>OPENSSL_ia32_rdseed_bytes</code>, and <code>OPENSSL_ia32_rdrand_bytes</code> (used for RNG).</p>

<p>This disables a compile-time optimization where OpenSSL compiles C code to assembly using 29 lines of perl code. It only works for the C code in <code>ecp_nistz256_table.c</code>, which defines a giant table. Presumably, this is done to avoid overloading the compiler with a lot of work, since the table is quite large.</p>

<p>Since the table is meant to be used from C code, it's easier for Fil-C to just compile <code>ecp_nistz256_table.c</code> with the Fil-C compiler. So, we disable this part of the perlasm.</p>

<p>The code often talks about "limbs" of a 256-bit value, where a limb is a machine word (so 64 bits in our case, since Fil-C is all about X86_64).

<p>I think this change is unnecessary. It's here because I used to have an assembly wrapper in this file, but later removed it.</p>

<h3>That's It!</h3>

<p>That's the whole ~90KB patch to OpenSSL 3.3.1 to make it possible to use the constant-time crypto assembly code while compiling OpenSSL'c C code with Fil-C.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks to these changes, using OpenSSL compiled with Fil-C is a net security improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All of the C code (i.e. most of OpenSSL) is compiled with Fil-C, and so it becomes totally memory safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Any code that is written in assembly is still assembled the same way as it is normally in an OpenSSL build. Therefore, we are not introducing any timing side channel regressions by using C code instead of assembly code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's still possible to compile OpenSSL with <code>no-asm</code> and get a fully memory-safe version with no assembly code, with the risk that the C code has timing side channels. However, I don't recommend doing that. Consider that if you examine the <a href="https://openssl-library.org/news/vulnerabilities/">OpenSSL vulnerabilities</a> going back to the beginning of 2023, there is <em>not a single vulnerability</em> in Linux/X86_64 assembly. There is one vulnerability in the Windows version of X86_64 assembly (because Windows has a weird calling convention). There is one vulnerability in PowerPC code and one ARM vulnerability (which is admittedly sad). But there are <em>many</em> vulnerabilities in C code. Therefore, it's unlikely that using memory-unsafe assembly on Linux/X86_64 introduces much attack surface. And it is likely that using assembly reduces the timing side-channel attack surface.</p>
